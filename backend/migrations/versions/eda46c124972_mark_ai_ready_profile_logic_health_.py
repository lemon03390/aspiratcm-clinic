Revision ID: eda46c124972
Revises: 990010ad9980
Create Date: 2025-04-09 03:02:20.849376

This revision does not apply schema changes, but documents the introduction
of backend logic that automatically constructs and maintains the 'health_profile'
JSONB field in the 'patients' table during patient creation and update.

This enhancement prepares the system for future AI integration, enabling
structured patient data retrieval and semantic analysis.
